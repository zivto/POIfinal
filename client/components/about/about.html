        <center><h2>INTERESTING AND FUN FACTS ABOUT NEW YORK CITY</h2></center>
        <br>
        <p>Without further ado, here are 42 interesting, fun and quirky facts about New York City!</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>1. New York City is made up of five boroughs: Manhattan, The Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island. So, please, do not use the term Manhattan as a synonym of New York City</p>
        <br>
        <p>2. Four of the five boroughs are located on islands. Manhattan and Staten Island are their own islands.  Queens and Brooklyn are in the western tip of Long Island.  The Bronx is the only borough located on the mainland</p>

        <p>3. Because of the islands situation, the different parts of the city are accessed by bridges or tunnels. Get prepared to pay to use those connectors (the price varies from $ 3to $7)</p>
        <br>
        <p>4. We are using the term borough to refer to the different areas of New York but borough is equivalent to a county. The funny thing is that Brooklyn is in Kings County and Queens is in Queens County.  So, the Kings and Queens reside side by side.  No kidding!</p>
